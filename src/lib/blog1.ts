**Introducing the Specified Skilled Worker (SSW) Visa Application Guide.**

<img src="/images/blog-1.png" alt="SSW Visa" />
**What is the SSW Visa?**
Think of the **SSW visa** as a special work permit for **Japan**. The Japanese government started it in 2019 to let people from other countries with certain job skills come and work in specific jobs where Japan needs more workers.

**Why did Japan create this Visa?**
Japan has a problem: its population is getting older, and not enough babies are being born. This means they don't have enough people to do all the jobs needed. The **SSW visa** helps fill these job openings by inviting skilled foreign workers.

\***\*Good things about the SSW visa:\*\***

- You can work in one of 14 specific job areas that need workers.
- There are two types: SSW(i) and SSW(ii) with different rules.
- You can stay for different amounts of time depending on the type.
- With SSW(ii), you might be able to bring your family.
- It could be a way to live in Japan permanently later on.
- ou can use Japan's healthcare system.
- It's a chance to live and work in Japan and experience its culture.

**How it compares to other work visas:**
The SSW visa is moderately easy to get compared to some others. It lets you stay longer than some and is specifically for those 14 job areas. You also have good worker rights.

**Who can apply for the SSW Visa?**

- **Age:** There's no strict age limit, but you should be old enough to work.

- **Nationality:** People from any country can apply, but Japan has special agreements with some Asian countries.
- **Health and Character:** You need to be healthy, show a health certificate, and not have a criminal record. You should also be a good person.

- **Skills:** You need to have the right skills for the job you want to do. You'll need to pass a skills test for that job. Some jobs might also need work experience.

- **Japanese Language:** You need to know some basic Japanese, at least enough for everyday life and work. Usually, this means passing a test
  like the JLPT N4. Some jobs might need you to know more Japanese.

**Important Note:** _The exact rules can change, so always check the newest official information!_

**The Two Types of SSW Visas:**

- **SSW(i):** This is the basic level. You can stay for up to 5 years in total. You cannot bring your family. You need basic Japanese (like JLPT N4). You can work in any of the 14 job areas.

- **SSW(ii):** This is for higher-skilled workers. You can renew this visa as long as you meet the rules, so you can stay for a long time. You can bring your husband or wife and children. You need to know more Japanese than for SSW(i). Right now, this type is only for jobs in Construction and Shipbuilding.

**Main Differences:**

<table>
<tr>
<th>Feature</th>
<th>SSW(i)</th>
<th>SSW(ii)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Skill Level</td>
<td>Basic to medium</td>
<td>Advanced</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stay Length</td>
<td>Up to 5 years total</td>
<td>Can stay indefinitely</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Family</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>Yes (spouse and children)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Job Areas</td>
<td>All 14</td>
<td>Only 2 (Construction, Ships)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Japanese Needed</td>
<td>Basic (JLPT N4)</td>
<td>More</td>
</tr>
</table>

**Moving from SSW(i) to SSW(ii):**
If you have an **SSW(i)** visa, you might be able to switch to **SSW(ii)** later. To do this, you need to gain more skills and experience, improve your Japanese, and apply for SSW(ii) in one of the eligible job areas (Construction or Shipbuilding for now).
